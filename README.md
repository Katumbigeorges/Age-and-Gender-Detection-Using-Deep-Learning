- PIP (Python package manager)
- Required Python libraries (specified in requirements.txt)

## Installation Steps
1. Clone the repository:
	bash
git clone https://github.com/Katumbigeorges/Age-and-Gender-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning.git
cd Age-and-Gender-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning
	

	Install required packages:
	bash
python -m pip install --user -r requirements.txt
	

3. Run the application:
	bash
python app.py

1. Launch the application following the installation steps
2. Access the web interface through your browser
3. Upload an image containing a face
4. View the age and gender predictions in real-time

## Technical Details
### Model Architecture
- Utilizes deep learning models for age and gender prediction
- Age prediction implemented as a regression problem
- Gender detection implemented as binary classification
- CNN-based architecture for feature extraction

### Limitations
- Predictions are dependent on image quality
- Designed for single-face analysis
- May have varying accuracy across different age ranges and demographics
- Performance affected by lighting conditions and facial orientation
